## Additional Microverse Adjustments

### General

- Add descriptive README file to your repositories.
- Use meaningful names for your Pull Requests and add a short summary of its content.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Do not commit files that are not related to the project. Instead, add them to [.gitignore file].
- Do not commit inline comments. They will make your project look messy. If you need to review a previous version of your code, you can always use git history.

### Project specific

- Make sure that all foreign keys have corresponding indexes in Database, as it will make your database performance better.
- Remember about tests in your code
- Refresher: Test Driven Development
- Add unit tests for models associations and validations (use Rspec hint)
- Add integrations tests for authentication and events managment (use Rspec and Capybara hint)
- Hint: Setting up Rspec and Capybara
